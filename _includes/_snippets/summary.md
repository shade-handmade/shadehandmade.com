My name is Ian, and I create fine woodwork in my home in central Ohio.
My belief is that all homes should have at least one piece of **well crafted**
hardwood furniture to last a lifetime. With thousands of years of international
heritage, and hundreds of timeless designs and styles, fine woodwork is a sure
way to improve your home, and in time, the homes of your children and
grandchildren. Every home has a unique space and a unique feel, and sometimes
you just can't find the perfect piece of furniture. I **love** working directly with
customers to design and build the perfect piece for your space, and one that
will last a lifetime.
