  <h3>Quality</h3>
</header>

Part of the **beauty** of handmade furniture is the ability for the maker to be
**closer to the piece**. That means I can ensure every part of the piece exceeds
my standards for **quality**. Before any creation leaves the shop, I spend time
inspecting the whole piece for any defects and issues.
