  <h3>Care and Detail</h3>
</header>

I use simple, safe, and strong finishes. Chemical finishes contain airborne
toxins called VOC’s, which can be dangerous to both me and my customers. I
prefer simple, **natural finishes** that I mix myself in-house. They can be just as
strong, and preserve the natural feel and beauty of the wood. In my opinion,
that’s well worth the extra time.
