  <h3>Built to last</h3>
</header>

Every piece I make is **built to last**. I use stable hardwoods, strong glues, and
the same techniques that were used 2000 years ago. Mixing modern technology and
old techniques allows me to make the perfect piece strong and permanent, but
without the excess time.
