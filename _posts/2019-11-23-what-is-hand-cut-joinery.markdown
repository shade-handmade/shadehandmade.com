Joinery is the way two or more pieces of wood are connected. There ase many
types, both vintage and modern. Typically, the intention of fine joinery in
woodwork is to provide the strongest possible joint, while also eliminating the
need for mechanical fasteners like screws. <!--more--> While there are
exceptions, most joints are held in place with glue. Glue is strongest when its
used to connect“long grain to long grain.” This means a place where the grain
runs parallel to the surface. Many joints, like the bridle joint shown above,
allow ample long grain surface area for the glue to adhere, giving it far
superior strength.

Joints can also be decorative, like dovetails. They allow you to see how the
different parts are connected, and have a subtle and beautiful look in any
space. Power tools and modern methods can cut some joints, but they have major
limitations. Hand cut joinery employs the use of hand tools, like hand saws and
chisels. This allows me to get in close with each part of each joint, and fine
tune them for the perfect fit. In short, it means they’re stronger, and
typically look better too. Power tools also have size limits. Things like drill
bits and blades can only get so small before they would break under the strain
of the motor. Many hand saws have a blade thickness of ten thousands of an inch
or less. This means I can saw fine lines, and create tighter, neater, and
stronger joints.

Not all pieces or parts require all the effort or detail to be strong, and
that’s where modern joinery techniques are perfect. They’re faster, easier, well
hidden, and don’t often sacrifice too much strength. I find that a good mix of
both types help create a piece that’s strong and beautiful, but doesn’t require
months to make. If you’re interested in what different joints look like, or
which ones would be right to use in your project, there’s a section in the
gallery page showcasing different joints that I’ve made previously.
